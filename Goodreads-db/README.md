## Directory Structure

- `/data`: Contains the source data files
  - `goodreads_test.csv`: Test dataset
  - `goodreads_book_works.json`: Book works data in JSON format
  - `Goodreads_books_with_genres.csv`: Books with genre information

- `/db`: Directory for the SQLite database file
  - The database is created as `goodreads-db.sqlite`

- `/src`: Source code for database creation and operations
  - `create_db.py`: Creates the database schema with tables for books, authors, genres, users, ratings, and reviews
  - `db_fill.py`: Populates the database with data from CSV files
  - `db_functions.py`: Helper functions for database operations
  - `objects.py`: Object definitions for books, authors, etc.
  - `utils.py`: Utility functions

- `/notebooks`: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration
  - `Goodreads-db-exploration.ipynb`: Notebook for exploring the database

## Database Schema

The database consists of the following tables:

- `Books`: Book information (ID, title, ISBN, language, publication year, etc.)
